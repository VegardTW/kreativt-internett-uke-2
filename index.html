        <h1> Apple Lisa 1983 </h1>
        <img src="bilder2/Apple_Lisa_Office_System_3.1 – stort.jpeg"/>
        <p> The year was 1982 and Apple was launching a new personal computer: The Apple Lisa. It was affected by its
            high price, insufficient software, unreliable Apple FileWare floppy disks. Only 10,000 were sold in two
            years and
            considered a commercial failure. Despite this Lisa became Apple’s most influential failures.
            There was a time when a majority of personal computer users interacted with their machines via command-line
            interfaces. Apple Lisa was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and a mouse. This
            technology allowed users to interact directly with their content in a way that a command line never allowed.
